    "If your emulator had feelings, it'd file a harassment claim.",
    "The only foreplay this app knows is WM_COPYDATA and a dirty handshake.",
    "Memory addresses. Hardware control. Zero shame. Infinite trauma.",
    "Extracts emulator memory like it's harvesting souls for an unlicensed USB exorcism.",
    "Built from stack overflows, electrical burns, and pure spite.",
    "It doesn't just poll memory — it possesses it, vomits hex, and whispers it to your LEDs in tongues.",
    "Jamming raw hex into your hardware like it owes it rent.",
    "The reason your LEDs need therapy.",
    "Mounts your emulator, reads its memory raw, and finishes in your PacDrive.",
    "Polls your RAM harder than your ex polled your mates.",
    "This isn't software. It's digital BDSM with zero safe words.",
